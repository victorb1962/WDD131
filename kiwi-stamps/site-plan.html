      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I work with software and currently learning to develop web pages with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. One of my hobbies is collecting New Zealand and
      <p>Australian stamps which I started when I was in elementary school but in my adult years, I have lost track of what I have in my stamp collection.</p>
      <p>My goal is to build a web page to take an inventory of my stamp collection, organize it, and present it digitally. It will include the ability to
        evaluate each stamp with current online prices, and present stamps online for sale that has been flag as being available.</p>
      <p>There must be many stamp collectors who needing help to inventory their stamp collection and to keep it organized. Are you a stamp collector needing help? I can help you!</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>There will be several target audiences for this website. The primary target audience will be stamp collectors who want the ability to organize, present and document their
        collection with the emphasis on New Zealand and Australian stamps but it can be available for stamps from all countries.</p>
      <p>These collectors can then share their collection with the wider internet audience of stamp enthusiasts. They can also show prices for items they wish to sell to other stamp collectors.</p>
      <p>Linked pages will contain information of interest about stamps, their history, events, and stamp collecting clubs, and social links.</p>

        Postal services in New Zealand have existed since at least 1831, when the Postmaster-General of New South Wales deputed a Bay of Islands merchant to
        receive and return mail. Governor William Hobson issued an ordinance covering postal matters, although the British government retained control until 1848.

        <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        First stamps<br>
        In 1850, New Zealand was a frontier colony with only a small European population. However, in line with other countries and after five years of planning by the New Zealand Government, a system for prepayment of postage on correspondence was introduced with the issue of the first imperforated stamps (prepayment of postage dues was not made compulsory until 1862).
        Their design was based on a full face portrait of Queen Victoria in her state robes at the time of her coronation in 1837, by Alfred Edward Chalon. Hence these stamps are often called the "Full Face Queens" or "Chalon Heads".
      </p>
      <p>
        1940 Centennial<br>
        Planning for the commemorative 1940 Centennial of British Sovereignty issue began in The penny stamp features the Endeavour and Captain Cook with the map of New Zealand that Cook produced after circumnavigating both islands in 1769.
      </p>
      <p>
        ANZAC Stamps<br>
        The 1936 ANZAC stamps were the first New Zealand stamps to commemorate the Gallipoli campaign. In 1958 the New Zealand Returned Services Association suggested that the Post Office issue stamps to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the landing of Anzac troops on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey on the 25th of April 1915. Stamps in this issue show Anzac Cove where the troops landed.
